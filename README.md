# Machine Learning Clustering Analysis on Custom and Gaming Datasets

## Overview

This repository demonstrates advanced clustering analysis using custom and gaming datasets. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to uncover hidden patterns and groupings within the data.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Multiple clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Model evaluation and selection
- Interactive visualizations
- Pre-trained models and scalers for quick inference

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Devnath03/Machine_Learning_Clustering-Analysis-on-Custom-and-Gaming-Datasets.git
   cd Machine_Learning_Clustering-Analysis-on-Custom-and-Gaming-Datasets
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**
   - Use `main.py` for script-based execution.
   - Explore `Cluster2.ipynb` and `Clusters.ipynb` for step-by-step analysis and visualization.

## Usage

- Load datasets from the provided CSV files.
- Preprocess and scale features using the included scaler.
- Train clustering models and visualize results.
- Save and load models for future inference.
- 
## Results

- Discover distinct clusters in both custom and gaming datasets.
- Visualize cluster assignments and feature distributions.
- Evaluate clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score.
